Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. It can damage your liver. This swelling and damage can affect how well your liver functions. Hepatitis can be an acute (short-term) infection or a chronic (long-term) infection. Some types of hepatitis cause only acute infections. Other types can cause both acute and chronic infections. There are different types of hepatitis, with different causes: Hepatitis A and hepatitis E usually spread through contact withfoodor water that was contaminated with an infected person's stool. You can also get hepatitis E by eating undercooked pork, deer, or shellfish. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis D spread through contact with the blood of someone who has the disease. Hepatitis B and D may also spread through contact with other body fluids. This can happen in many ways, such as sharing drug needles or having unprotected sex. The risks are different for the different types of hepatitis. For example, with most of the viral types, your risk is higher if you have unprotected sex.  People who drink a lot over long periods of time are at risk for alcoholic hepatitis. Some people with hepatitis do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected. If you do have symptoms, they may include: If you have an acute infection, your symptoms can start anywhere between 2 weeks to 6 months after you got infected. If you have a chronic infection, you may not have symptoms until many years later. Chronic hepatitis can lead to complications such ascirrhosis(scarring of the liver), liver failure, andliver cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment of chronic hepatitis may prevent these complications. To diagnose hepatitis, your health care provider: Treatment for hepatitis depends on which type you have and whether it is acute or chronic. Acute viral hepatitis often goes away on its own. To feel better, you may just need to rest and get enough fluids. But in some cases, it may be more serious. You might even need treatment in a hospital. There are different medicines to treat the different chronic types of hepatitis. Possible other treatments may include surgery and other medical procedures. People who have alcoholic hepatitis need to stop drinking. If your chronic hepatitis leads to liver failure or liver cancer, you may need aliver transplant. There are different ways to prevent or lower your risk for hepatitis, depending on the type of hepatitis. For example, not drinking too much alcohol can prevent alcoholic hepatitis.

To diagnose hepatitis, your health care provider: Treatment for hepatitis depends on which type you have and whether it is acute or chronic. Acute viral hepatitis often goes away on its own. To feel better, you may just need to rest and get enough fluids. But in some cases, it may be more serious. You might even need treatment in a hospital. There are different medicines to treat the different chronic types of hepatitis. Possible other treatments may include surgery and other medical procedures. People who have alcoholic hepatitis need to stop drinking. If your chronic hepatitis leads to liver failure or liver cancer, you may need aliver transplant. There are different ways to prevent or lower your risk for hepatitis, depending on the type of hepatitis. For example, not drinking too much alcohol can prevent alcoholic hepatitis. There are vaccines to prevent hepatitis A and B. Autoimmune hepatitis cannot be prevented.

Hepatitis can be an acute (short-term) infection or a chronic (long-term) infection. Some types of hepatitis cause only acute infections. Other types can cause both acute and chronic infections. There are different types of hepatitis, with different causes: Hepatitis A and hepatitis E usually spread through contact withfoodor water that was contaminated with an infected person's stool. You can also get hepatitis E by eating undercooked pork, deer, or shellfish. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis D spread through contact with the blood of someone who has the disease. Hepatitis B and D may also spread through contact with other body fluids. This can happen in many ways, such as sharing drug needles or having unprotected sex. The risks are different for the different types of hepatitis. For example, with most of the viral types, your risk is higher if you have unprotected sex.  People who drink a lot over long periods of time are at risk for alcoholic hepatitis. Some people with hepatitis do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected. If you do have symptoms, they may include: If you have an acute infection, your symptoms can start anywhere between 2 weeks to 6 months after you got infected. If you have a chronic infection, you may not have symptoms until many years later. Chronic hepatitis can lead to complications such ascirrhosis(scarring of the liver), liver failure, andliver cancer.
